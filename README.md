This project is to explore, analyze and build machine learning models from user behavior data. This project analyze the standard VPC Flow Logs from AWS, to detect potential threat from the data file.

Public sector organizations operate external facing applications with broad multi-task user interfaces. There are significant investments made in human-centered design, but new opportunities exist to enhance personalization of the interfaces through machine learning and AI to reduce burden on the public user in navigation and task performance. The problem involves leveraging information from user roles, prior behavior, schedules of required activities, and other characteristics to predict the intended reasons why users are entering a system at any given time, and where they plan to navigate and work. This information would be used to facilitate the users in those navigations.

The objectives of this project are:

- Clean dirty log data and transform it for analytics.
- Exploratory data analysis to find user activity levels for different events, and user interaction with web components.
- Propose any hypothesis and test using selected features.
- Build machine learning models to predict user behaviors, including but not limited to signup, churn, etc.
- Identify user behaviors based on the AI/ML-based predictive models.
